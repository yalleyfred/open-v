## üé® Style Guidelines

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Prefer explicit types over `any`

### Code Style

```typescript
// Good
interface User {
  id: number;
  email: string;
  name: string;
}

const createUser = async (userData: CreateUserDto): Promise<User> => {
  // Implementation
};

// Bad
const createUser = (userData: any): any => {
  // Implementation
};
```

### File Organization

- Place files in appropriate directories
- Use descriptive file names
- Export interfaces and types from dedicated files
- Group related functionality together

### API Design

- Use RESTful conventions
- Consistent response formats
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Clear error messages

## üß™ Testing

### Writing Tests

- Add tests for all new features
- Test both success and error cases
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe('UserService', () => {
  describe('createUser', () => {
    it('should create a new user with valid data', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });

    it('should throw error for duplicate email', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
